		"Arakyd originally designed probe droids to wander space in search of viable <Lookup (\"hyper\");@hyperspace> routes and undiscovered planets. When the <Lookup (\"Galactic Civ\");@Galactic Civil War> erupted, Arakyd enhanced the probot's sensors and stealth functions, then sold the droids to the <Lookup (\"Empire\");@Empire> with the promise that the probots would be instrumental in locating Rebel bases. The probots proved successful, and <Lookup (\"Vad\");@Darth Vader> personally ordered the construction of improved Viper droids for use in his search to find <Lookup (\"Skywalker, Luk\");@Luke Skywalker>.\r\n\r\nProbots are launched from capital ships in small hyperdrive pods. These capsules land on a target planet and release the probot, which then begins a thorough exploration of the world. Probots utilize repulsorlift and thruster units to move over or through virtually every type of terrain, often reaching speeds of about 40 kilometers per hour. While traveling, they employ acoustic, electromagnetic, motive, seismic, and olfactory sensors to detect any signs of habitation. Their array of devices includes optical cameras, zoom imagers, infrared scopes, magnetic imagers, radar and sonar transceivers, and radiation meters. Four manipulator arms and a high-torque grasping arm allow the probot to take samples from the planet. Retractable sensor probes can be extended from the probot's body to provide detailed scans of objects.\r\n\r\nProbots search endlessly for signs of life and report their findings to Imperials via restricted Imperial HoloNet communication frequencies. When they encounter life-forms, probots seldom attack, although they are equipped with a single <Lookup (\"blaster\");@blaster>. Rather, they observe until they are spotted and attacked, at which point they promptly self-destruct.\r\n\r\nAs the Galactic Civil War intensified, the basic probot design spawned the efficient Hunter-Killer probot. At 150 meters tall, they are among the largest combat droids ever produced. H-K probots are deployed for Imperial customs inspections, blockade enforcement, and pursuit and detainment operations. It operates best in deep space, where it scans starships for signs of smuggling or other crimes. A powerful tractor beam allows the H-K probot to pull a target starship into an internal security chamber within the droid's belly. The chamber measures 30 meters by 10 meters and can hold most freighters. Two quad blasters and a pair of ion cannons located in the hold will activate if the captured ship attempts to flee.",

The most familiar are the R2 units, including Luke Skywalker's loyal R2-D2. Many astromechs are designed to fit into special sockets aboard starfighters such as the Y-wing and X-wing. During flight, they can navigate, access hyperspace coordinates stored in their memory banks, and effect in-flight repairs.",

		"Industrial Automaton",
		"Assist with starship navigation and in-flight repairs",
		"1 meter tall",
		"1,450 credits",
		"Industrial Automaton's first attempts to create an astromech droid surfaced with the design of the P2 unit. Like future models, the astromech prototype had a rotating head, numerous retractable manipulator arms, and three-wheeled legs. Although large and cumbersome, the droid served well as a maintenance and repair unit for bulk cruisers and similar vessels. Unfortunately, Industrial Automaton became involved in a costly technology-infringement lawsuit and the P2 series was discontinued.\r\n\r\nEventually, Industrial Automaton completed the R1 unit. In order to save costs, the droids were housed in tall, black shells recycled from the Mark II Reactor Drone series. The R1 series comes standard with an advanced Intellex III computer, and the droid was the first astromech with the ability to calculate coordinates for a single <Lookup (\"hypers\");@hyperspace> jump. R1 units typically serve as technicians aboard capital warships and large freighters.\r\n\r\nBy far the most successful astromech droid is Industrial Automaton's <Lookup (\"R2 uni\");@R2> series. The droid is much more compact than its predecessors and equipped with a wide array of tools. Although originally designed as a diagnostic and repair unit, the R2 can also serve as a general utility droid and conduct information retrieval.\r\n\r\nThe R2 series was manufactured to fit perfectly into standard astromech sockets on military starfighters. Previously, the sockets were reserved for dedicated government models. While situated in the astromech socket, an R2 unit can monitor flight performance, isolate and repair technical problems, and reroute power throughout the shipboard systems. Due to its advanced processor, an R2 can perform over 10,000 operations per second to forecast potential problems. R2s can also store up to 10 sets of hyperspace coordinates and can even perform rudimentary flight maneuvers such as engine start-up and preflight taxiing. Due to its impressive abilities, the Industrial Automaton R2 unit quickly became popular with <Lookup (\"Old Rep\");@Old Republic> fighter jocks and the public at large.\r\n\r\nR2s are programmed with specifications on over 700 different spacecraft configurations. They also have impressive sensor packages that incorporate a full-spectrum transceiver and electromagnetic, heat, motion, and life-form detectors. An extendible video sensor can be used to inspect small spaces. Beneath an R2's shell lurks an array of amazing tools that includes two manipulator arms, an electric arc welder, a circular saw, a holographic projector, an internal cargo compartment, and a fire extinguisher.\r\n\r\nFollowing the success of the R2, Industrial Automaton manufactured the R3 and R4 units. The R3 has a more advanced Intellex V computer programmed with detailed statistics on every vessel in the Old Republic army. It primarily serves gunnery crews, security troopers, and naval chiefs of operation aboard capital warships. It can also be plugged into a starfighter, although it only carries five hyperspace coordinates.\r\n\r\nIn a successful attempt to sell droids to <Lookup (\"Outer Rim\");@Outer Rim> inhabitants, Industrial Automaton produced the inexpensive yet durable R4 unit. It is programmed with a detailed knowledge of many general-purpose craft, including <Lookup (\"landspee\");@landspeeders> and <Lookup (\"airspee\");@airspeeders>, and excels at repairing such vehicles. They are usually found in garages and machine shops, and are only rarely used aboard starfighters as they can only store a single set of hyperspace coordinates.\r\n\r\nR5 units represent Industrial Automaton's only real failure in the astromech market. While the most affordable of all astromechs, the R5 series lacks the R2's versatility and the R4's reliability. It also has a tendency to develop annoying personality quirks and is prone to a variety of malfunctions including blown motivators and chronic overheating. Starfighter pilots shunned the droid because it could only store one set of hyperspace coordinates. Because of its limitations, the R5 series was quietly discontinued. The <Lookup (\"Rebel All\");@Rebel Alliance> did reprogram and rebuild a number of R5 units, and these select droids are now capable of storing up to 10 sets of nav coordinates. <Lookup (\"Antilles\");@Wedge Antilles> used R5-D2 (nicknamed \"Mynock\") as his <Lookup (\"X-win\");@X-wing> astromech during the Battle of <Lookup (\"Borl\");@Borleias>. However, the droid's chronic shrieking forced Wedge to have Mynock's memory wiped. R5-D2 was subsequently renamed R5-G8, or \"Gate.\"\r\n\r\nMore recent astromech models include the R6 and R7 units. The R6's design is based largely on the R2, but it has an improved processor and can store up to 12 hyperspace jumps. Because of widespread prosperity caused by the rise of the <Lookup (\"New Rep\");@New Republic> and huge advances in technology, the R6 proved less expensive to produce than the R2 and thus attracted hordes of consumers.\r\n\r\nWhen <Lookup (\"Thrawn\");@Grand Admiral Thrawn> took control of the remnants of the <Lookup (\"Empire\");@Empire>, Industrial Automaton dedicated all its efforts to developing a new droid for use in the versatile E-wing starfighter used by New Republic forces. The resulting R7 proved to be the most sophisticated astromech ever constructed. It can store a staggering 15 sets of hyperspace coordinates and is completely protected against power surges and low-level ion blasts. Unfortunately, because the R7 is designed specifically for the E-wing, the droid works poorly in other starfighters.",

They manufactured the healing salve by combining translucent alayhi with a synthetic liquid chemical known as kavan. In a medical bacta tank, these particles are mixed with a colorless liquid called ambori, which mimics the patient's vital fluids and acts as a nutrient and disinfectant bath. Because bacta has a tendency to spoil when exposed to open air, the ambori is vital to preserve the bacta mixture.\r\n\r\nWhen properly administered, bacta can heal all but the most serious wounds. Wounded limbs can be submerged in small bacta tanks, but patients who have received multiple or life-threatening injuries must be fully immersed. A bacta-tank patient is fitted with a breath mask equipped with a microphone and audio speakers to allow him to communicate with doctors and droids. Throughout the bacta treatment, the healing process is bolstered by medicines, stim-shots, adrenaline boosters, and immunity enhancers.\r\n\r\nTwo companies, Zaltin and Xucphra, dominate the production and distribution of bacta and bacta tanks. When the <Lookup (\"Empire\");@Empire> rose to power, it forged agreements with both companies to seriously restrict bacta sales. Throughout the Galactic Civil War, the <Lookup (\"Rebel All\");@Rebel Alliance> suffered from continual bacta shortages. Two and one half years after the <Lookup (\"Endor, Bat\");@Battle of Endor>, bacta shortages reached all-time highs. As a result, the New Republic launched a campaign to liberate bacta production.

The bacterial particles actually seek out wounds, then promote amazingly quick tissue growth without scarring. <Lookup (\"Palp\");@Emperor Palpatine> realized the importance of bacta as a source of even more power and control so he shut down the satellite manufacturing centers and systematically suppressed small manufacturers in favor of the Zaltin and Xucphra corporations. Bacta then fell under the control of a cartel on Thyferra, and the corporations that distributed it became even more powerful than the Emperor intended. Bacta was universally accepted as a safe drug until Ashern rebels contaminated one lot. Millions of people exposed to it became allergic to bacta, particularly the citizens and soldiers on Imperial Center. Later, a Bacta War was fought over control of the healing substance.",

However, if the tractor beam's connection to the reactor is severed at any of the coupling sites, the beam becomes completely inoperative.
