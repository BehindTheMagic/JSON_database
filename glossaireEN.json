Beggar's Canyon, a valley formed by the confluence of at least three rivers millions of years earlier, was Luke Skywalker’s training ground. Here he and friends pushed their flying skills by racing skyhoppers through deep and twisted alleys, sometimes engaging in mock dogfights. Skywalker often hunted womp rats while flying his T-16 full out. Beggar’s Canyon is the site of Main Avenue, which goes straight for nearly two kilometers before making a sharp angled turn to the right, called Dead Man’s Turn. Another feature is the Stone Needle, a slender vertical rock with a narrow slot in the top lined with jagged stone “teeth.” Only the most experienced pilots can fly through it without crashing.",

The vine-coffee and vine-silk grown here account for 30 percent of Belsavis’s total economy.<br>The gangly, short-lived Mluki species are representative of Belsavis’s original population. The rift valleys were largely jungle until the Brathflen Corporation, Galactic Exotics, and Imperial Exports arrived and began cultivating cash crops. The quiet community of Plawal lies between steep cliffs of red-black rock and is run by Jevax, a Mluki who is Chief Person of Plawal. Rock benches leading up to the cliff walls provide a narrow foundation for homes and orchards. A thick sulfurous mist permeates the valley and can restrict visibility to just a few meters.<br>About a hundred years before the Galactic Civil War, Jedi Master Plett built a house and laboratory in the Plawal rift that served as a safe haven for Jedi and their families. Some 18 years before the Battle of Yavin, the Emperor commissioned the battlemoon <i>Eye of Palpatine</i> to wipe out the Jedi enclave, but the ship never arrived. The Emperor’s small backup force of interceptors bombed Plawal but were wiped out by Belsavis’s Y-wings. The Jedi departed for places unknown after erasing all knowledge of their presence from the minds of the city’s inhabitants. Han and Leia Organa Solo visited Belsavis eight years after the Battle of Endor and uncovered a plot by Roganda Ismaren, a long-time spy and onetime mistress of the late Emperor Palpatine, to forge a military alliance with the Senex Lords.",

A true beauty, Callista had lived with her family on the water world of Chad III, herding wander-kelp in a deep-water ranch. Strong in the Force, she partnered with Geith, who was also powerful. Both were killed in an attempt to destroy the <i>Eye of Palpatine</i>. But the Force, along with a strange power on the space station known as the Will, did not allow her spirit to perish. Instead, by inhabiting the computer, she kept anyone from activating the <i>Eye</i>’s deadly weapons, forcing the Empire to abandon the project.<br>Thirty years later, Luke boarded the <i>Eye</i> to destroy it forever with the help of two former students, Nichos Marr and Cray Mingla. Cray and Luke sensed Callista’s presence, and Luke saw her in his dreams. The dreams became reality when Callista communicated with Luke through the station’s computers, aiding the three in their project to destroy the <i>Eye</i>. Nichos and Cray planned to sacrifice themselves in the attempt, but at the last moment Callista and Cray used their remaining Force strength to transfer Callista’s essence into Cray’s body and enter an escape pod that was rescued by Luke’s ship. For the first time, a corporeal Callista was together with her love. But Callista had paid a big price, for she had lost all her Jedi skills and her ability to communicate with the Force. While that didn’t matter to Luke, Callista felt it made her only half a person, and she began a long pursuit to regain her powers.<br>Callista crossed paths again with Luke nine years after the Battle of Endor, after she had tried to warn his sister, Chief of State Leia Organa Solo, to stay away from the planet Nam Chorios and a meeting with the evil Seti Ashgad. Callista helped Leia hone her lightsaber skills, which came in handy when Leia fought Beldorion the Hutt to the death.

At about the same time, the new Corellian Diktat dissolved the Corellian Security Force and established a new, more Diktat-friendly Public Safety Service in its place, until New Republic representatives intervened. There is little work in the sector, and little prospect of any. The three dominant races (human, Drall, and Selonian) had been forced to get along because of the ever-present threat of punishment from the Empire. With that threat gone, all three are scrambling to assert their dominance in the sector.",

Located on the edge of the galaxy, the Corporate Sector borders the Aparo and Wyl sectors. The skylines of its many urban worlds are lit by the multicolored flashes of countless advertising signs. It offers the widest selection of products anywhere, and tourists come from all over the galaxy to purchase its unique goods. <br>The CSA is made up of dozens of contributing companies and is run by the 55 members of the Direx Board, who are in turn headed by the ExO. The CSA has exclusive rights to use the sector’s resources as it sees fit. Typically, the CSA uses up a planet’s resources, then moves on to another. It isn’t above using slave labor or grossly polluting the environment. Because there is no internal competition, the CSA can mark up prices of goods to many times their actual worth. Businesses in the sector accept only the Authority Cash Voucher and crystalline vertex.<br>A portion of the CSA’s enormous profits were secretly funneled to Emperor Palpatine, with the understanding that the Empire would take no direct role in the operation of the sector. Therefore, the CSA formed its own military forces, including Security Police (called Espos) and a comparatively poor and outdated starfleet. Planets in the Corporate Sector include Ammuud, Bonadan, Roonadan, Etti IV, Kalla, Kail, Kir, Orron III, Duroon, Mytus VII, Gaurick, Rampa, Mall’ordian, Reltooine, Knolstee, Mayro, and the Trianii colony worlds of Fibuli, Ekibo, Pypin, and Brochiib. The feline Trianii have been actively opposing the Corporate Sector’s annexation of their worlds, and much of the fighting between the two sides occurred in the Tingel Arm. An armistice in the conflict was recently called after three years of intensive fighting.<br>Originally established hundreds of years ago under the Old Republic, the Corporate Sector was once a group of several hundred systems, all devoid of intelligent life. The corporations allowed to operate in the sector could purchase entire regions of space but were held in check by the watchful eye of the Republic. During the Emperor’s rise to power, however, several corporate allies of Palpatine convinced him to expand the sector to encompass nearly 30,000 stars. Eleven native intelligent species were discovered in this expanded region, though this fact was effectively covered up. The CSA was established to manage the sector’s operations, kicking off the modern era of the Corporate Sector.<br>Han Solo and Chewbacca had several legendary exploits in the Corporate Sector during their early adventuring, including a jailbreak from the infamous Stars’ End penal colony. Following the Battle of Hoth, the Corporate Sector company Galactic Electronics developed a new mag-pulse weapons technology and sold it to the Rebel Alliance. In retaliation, the Imperial Star Destroyer <i>Glory</i> seized the corporation’s deep-space research facility. Emperor Palpatine once had plans to build a great palace for himself in the sector, and construction continued even after Palpatine’s apparent death at the Battle of Endor. Six years later, during the cloned Emperor’s reappearance, the Corporate Sector declared its neutrality in the conflict and began supplying weapons and arms to both sides.",

Brilliant and coldly efficient, ruthless and beautiful, with a full head of copper-colored hair and piercing green eyes, the admiral emerged from a long-hidden corner of the galaxy to become one of the Republic’s main military threats.<br>When she was younger, Daala suffered the taunts and unfair assignments that were to be expected in the sexist culture of the Empire. She excelled at one of the toughest military schools, the Imperial Academy on Carida, and finally caught the eye of Moff Tarkin, who took her on as a protégé and a lover. Tarkin wanted to keep both her and an ambitious new project he had conceived hidden from the Emperor. So he put Daala in charge of a top-secret weapons research facility, the Maw Installation, deep in the black-hole fields outside Kessel. He also gave her four Star Destroyers to command and the rank of admiral. The facility, which employed 180,000 people, produced plans and a prototype for the Death Star battle stations, the World Devastators used in battle against Mon Calamari, and the Sun Crusher fighter.<br>The Maw Installation was completely isolated for 11 years. When an Imperial shuttle finally arrived, Daala was shocked to find that its passengers were Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Kyp Durron, newly escaped from the Kessel spice mines. An interrogation revealed the stunning news of Tarkin’s death, the destruction of both Death Stars, and the fall of the Empire. The admiral decided to seek revenge by unleashing the power of her ultimate weapon, the Sun Crusher, against the New Republic. But Han Solo had already won over chief scientist Qwi Xux, who freed the three, and together they stole the only working model of the Sun Crusher. Admiral Daala took out her fury by blasting much of the Kessel fleet and a colony on Dantooine. She almost destroyed Mon Calamari but was thwarted by Admiral Ackbar.<br>Having lost two of her Star Destroyers, she retreated and planned the devastation of Coruscant, the seat of New Republic power. But Kyp Durron ferreted her out and launched sun-destroying torpedoes from the Sun Crusher, taking out a third Star Destroyer and badly damaging Daala’s ship, the <i>Gorgon</i>. The New Republic next engaged her at the Maw Installation, but she succeeded in downloading the most important weapons plans from the facility’s computers before igniting an explosion that destroyed the installation. Daala then slipped away to fight again.<br>With the <i>Gorgon</i> nearly worthless and her power diminished, Admiral Daala attempted to unite the feuding warlords who passed for Imperial authority. Because her undertaking was about to fail, she instead killed 13 of the leading warlords with nerve gas and took control of all Imperial forces and a new Super Star Destroyer that she called the <i>Knight Hammer</i>. Once again she went head to head with the best that the New Republic had to offer, and once again she failed. She barely escaped with her life, but remained ready to face another day and perhaps another battle.<br>Years later, Daala surfaced as president of the Independent Company of Settlers, a group more than 3,000 beings loyal to the old ways of doing things. The group purchased 1.5 billion acres on the planet Peduccis Chorios from the warlord K’iin of the Silver Unifir to live out their days. After top New Republic leaders thwarted a plot by the evil Seti Ashgad, Daala was reunited with her long-lost love, Liegeus Vorn.

Dathomir is inhabited by the Witches of Dathomir, a group of Force-sensitive women who ride fearsome rancors. The planet is covered with a wide variety of terrain including mountains, deserts, purple savannas, and forests of 80-meter trees and vines bearing hwotha berries. Indigenous life includes flying reptiles, piglike rodents, long whuffa worms, burra fish, and rancors. Semi-intelligent, two-legged reptiles live in the desert and call themselves the Blue Desert People. Humans came to Dathomir when a group of illegal arms manufacturers were exiled to the planet by the Jedi Knights. Several generations later, a rogue Jedi named Allya was also exiled to Dathomir. She began to teach the Force to the planet’s inhabitants and to her descendants, who also learned to tame the wild rancors. Nearly 400 years before the Battle of Yavin, the two-kilometer Jedi academy ship <i>Chu’unthor</i> crashed in a Dathomir tar pit. Jedi sent to recover the crashed ship were repulsed by the witches. Different clans of these witches (Singing Mountain, Frenzied River, and Misty Falls) were formed, including a group of dark siders calling itself the Nightsisters. Life among the clans followed a pattern of female dominance, and males were largely used as slaves for work or breeding.<br>Imperial forces constructed orbital shipyards and a penal colony on Dathomir’s surface. But after Emperor Palpatine learned the power of the Nightsisters’ leader, Gethzerion, he ordered all the prison’s ships destroyed to prevent her from leaving the planet. The stranded Imperials at the prison were then enslaved by Gethzerion and the other Nightsisters. Four years after the Battle of Endor, Han Solo won the planet in a high-stakes sabacc game from Warlord Omogg, who claimed it had been in her family for generations. Han’s subsequent adventures on the planet resulted in the destruction of both the Nightsisters and the forces of Warlord Zsinj. About 15 years after the Battle of Endor, a new order of Nightsisters based in the Great Canyon emerged. This clan, founded by Luke Skywalker’s former student Brakiss, allied itself with the remnants of the Empire, treated males as equals, and sent the best Force students to be trained at the Empire’s Shadow Academy.",

From a tousled-haired eight-year-old whose youth was forfeited to the mines to a Jedi Knight—with a detour through the dark side—Kyp Durron has led a life of extremes. He and his parents were carted off by stormtroopers one night from their home on the Deyer colony in the Anoat system. The crime of the politically active parents: speaking out against the Empire’s destruction of Alderaan and its billions of inhabitants. Kyp and his parents were sent to the Imperial Correctional Facility on the planet Kessel where they were pressed into slave labor, mining the powerful drug called glitterstim spice from pitch-black tunnels. Kyp’s older brother, Zeth, was shunted off to the grueling Imperial Academy on Carida.<br>Kyp spent his formative years alone and in darkness. His parents were executed during a battle that resulted in the smuggler Moruth Doole gaining complete control over the prison and the mines. Then a new prisoner, an old woman named Vima-Da-Boda, a Jedi Knight in the days of the Old Republic, sensed an aptitude for the Force in Kyp. She started training him in some Force skills until one day she, too, was taken away by authorities. Seven years after the Battle of Endor, two new prisoners met Kyp: Han Solo and Chewbacca, who had been shot down by Doole while on a diplomatic mission to Kessel.<br>Han discovered quickly that the 16-year-old Kyp had great aptitude for the Force. It came in handy in the lower tunnels, when he, Chewbacca, and several other slaves and guards were attacked by the giant spiders that created the glitterstim. They then developed an escape plan and made it off Kessel in a stolen Imperial cargo ship, only to be pulled into the Maw, a cluster of black-hole fields. Kyp’s Force powers helped them navigate to the relative safety of a top-secret Imperial weapons installation run by Admiral Daala. Their escape from the installation, with Kyp wearing a stormtrooper’s armor, led to a fierce space battle that resulted in the destruction of most of Moruth Doole’s space fleet.<br>Luke Skywalker invited Kyp to become a Jedi trainee on Yavin 4. Within a week, he had surpassed all the other initiates. But his impatience and anger made him a target for the dark side in the form of the long-dead Sith Lord Exar Kun, whose still-strong spirit was trapped in a Yavin temple. Kyp started training in secret with Kun but believed he could control the dark side. Still, in an act of vengeance, he removed the memories from the mind of reformed Imperial weapons developer Qwi Xux. He then joined Exar Kun to raise a major Imperial weapon, the Sun Crusher, from its burial grounds in the heart of the gas giant Yavin. When Luke Skywalker tried to intervene, Kyp and Kun trapped Luke’s spirit outside his body, placing the Jedi in a state near death.<br>Kyp tracked down his most hated enemy, Admiral Daala, as she was about to attack Coruscant, and nearly destroyed her. Next he tried to find his brother on Carida, but the rescue attempt failed as he accidentally incinerated his brother along with the planet. Later, as Kyp was about to destroy the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> with Han Solo and Lando Calrissian aboard, he was freed from Exar Kun’s influence when the other Jedi trainees succeeded in destroying Kun’s spirit. A recovered Luke offered to continue Kyp’s training if he forever renounced the dark side. On their way to destroy the Sun Crusher once and for all, Luke and Kyp ran into another battle with Admiral Daala. Kyp managed to destroy both the Sun Crusher and a prototype Death Star, barely escaping with his life.",

It saw the destruction of the second Death Star battle station and the deaths of Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, who was later reborn as a clone.<br>The Rebel Alliance had learned of the secret construction of an even more powerful second Death Star and was determined to destroy it before it could be completed. Bothan spies also learned that the Emperor would pay the station a personal visit. Both pieces of information, it turned out, had been planted by Palpatine to set a trap for the Alliance.<br>As Admiral Ackbar gathered the Alliance fleet around the planet Sullust, a special strike team was sent ahead to sabotage the shield generator protecting the unfinished Death Star. The team, led by Han Solo and including Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Chewbacca, the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, and a squad of Rebel commandos, used a stolen Imperial shuttle to get through the Empire’s forces and down to Endor’s forest moon. The timing had to be perfect. The strike team had to disable or destroy the shield generator by the time the Rebel fleet emerged from hyperspace so that the surprise attack could begin.<br>But the “unfinished” Death Star had a fully operational superlaser. And a full legion of stormtroopers and other Imperial soldiers were waiting to defend the shield generator and capture the Rebel commandos. While the strike team battled on Endor’s moon, the Rebel fleet arrived to find the protective shield still in place.<br>The Emperor’s plan called for the Imperial fleet to remain in reserve on the far side of the moon while TIE fighters destroyed the outnumbered Rebel ships. Next, the Death Star’s superlaser would vaporize all of the Alliance’s capital ships. The Rebels gained some time by using the Empire’s Star Destroyers as shields.<br>On the forest moon, the native Ewoks helped free the strike team, allowing it to carry out its sabotage mission. When the shield generators were destroyed, the protective shield surrounding the Death Star disappeared. Then Lando Calrissian and his starfighters moved in to attack. The <i>Millennium Falcon</i> and Wedge Antilles’s X-wing flew into the unfinished Death Star’s superstructure and fired proton torpedoes at the battle station’s power regulator. Simultaneously, Lando Calrissian fired concussion missiles at the main reactor. The resulting explosions destroyed the Death Star.

Like most forms of energy, the Force can be manipulated, and it is the knowledge and predisposition to do so that empowers the Jedi Knights, and the Dark Jedi. There are two sides to the Force: The light side bestows great knowledge, peace, and an inner serenity; the dark side is filled with fear, anger, and the vilest aggression. <br>Yet both sides of the Force, the life-affirming and the destructive, are part of the natural order. Through the Force, a Jedi Knight can see far-off places, perform amazing feats, and accomplish what would otherwise be impossible. A Jedi’s strength flows from the Force, but a true Jedi uses it for knowledge and defense, never attack. The Force is a powerful ally, however it is used.<br>There are three major Force skills: control, sense, and alter. Only Force-sensitive living things can master Jedi skills and the techniques that they control, but the training to reach full Jedi status usually requires much time and great patience. Control is the ability of a Jedi to control his or her own inner Force. With this skill, a Jedi learns to master the functions of his or her own body. The sense skill helps Jedi sense the Force in things beyond themselves. Jedi learn to feel the bonds that connect all things. “You must feel the Force around you,” Jedi Master Yoda once told Luke Skywalker. “Here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere!” The alter skill allows a Jedi to change the distribution and nature of the Force to create illusions, move objects, and change the perceptions of others.<br>A Dark Jedi gives in to his or her anger. “If you once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny,” Yoda warned Luke. Emperor Palpatine, on the other hand, urged Luke to continue down the path of blind fury and aggression. “Give in to your anger,” he told Luke. “Strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey toward the dark side will be complete.”",

It took years, however, before scattered pockets of resistance could be organized into the Alliance to Restore the Republic. One by one at first, then in a trickle that became a flood, guerrilla groups and planets cast their lots with the nascent Rebel Alliance. The galaxy shuddered on the brink of full-scale civil war. Alliance leader Mon Mothma wrote the Formal Declaration of Rebellion, alerting the Emperor that the pesky opposition was now full-fledged, organized resistance. Although Rebel firepower didn’t come close to matching that of the Empire, events were moving too swiftly for the Rebels to plan and execute an orderly buildup.<br>The exact moment when the full-scale Galactic Civil War began cannot be pinpointed with certainty, but the completion of the Empire’s Death Star battle station and its annihilation of the planet Alderaan and its billions of people certainly galvanized the opposition. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, the civil war was in full swing. Star system after star system slipped through the Empire’s nets to join the Alliance, and war rocked the galaxy from the settlements of the Outer Rim Territories to the majestic spires of Imperial Center. The Battle of Endor, when the second Death Star was destroyed and the Emperor apparently died, marked the end of the full-scale war and the birth of the New Republic.",

He did the job so well that Odumin put him on retainer for other “messy” jobs. Gallandro was on the planet Ammuud when he first encountered Han Solo, who had been trapped by security police. Han tricked him into grabbing a case that sent shocks to Gallandro’s gun hand, and Gallandro let Solo go. They later encountered each other on Dellalt, where both were searching for the long-lost treasure of Xim the Despot. Han found the treasure chambers and Gallandro challenged him to a duel. Gallandro fired first, hitting Han in the shoulder, and then attempted to kill one of Han’s associates. But the chamber had been rigged to combat such disruptions, and a dozen lasers shot forth and incinerated Gallandro on the spot.",

Ithor is a beautiful, if humid, world of unspoiled rain forests, rivers, and waterfalls.<br>Three continents have been developed, although they still appear to be overgrown jungles to most visitors. The Ithorians consider the jungle sacred and enter it only during emergencies. Instead, they have constructed vast floating cities that hover above the Bafforr tree tops in no particular pattern. (They include the <i>Tree of Tarintha</i>, the <i>Cloud-Mother</i>, and the Grand Herd Ship <i>Tafanda Bay</i>.) Ithorian starships, essentially herd cities with hyperdrives, travel the spacelanes selling unusual and rare merchandise. Brath-flen Corporation, which operates on Belsavis, is a major Ithorian trading company.<br>At times the Mother Jungle has been known to “call” certain Ithorians to live on the surface as ecological priests, who never return to their herd cities. All Ithorians are bound by the Ithorian Law of Life, which states that for every plant harvested, two must be planted in its place. A large grove of semi-intelligent Bafforr trees, located in the Cathor Hills, was half-destroyed by the Empire. This grove acts as an intelligent hive mind and is worshipped by the Ithorian people. In addition to the Bafforr, Ithor’s flora includes blueleaf, tremmin, fiddlehead bull-ferns, donar flowers, and indyup trees. Animal life includes the manollium bird, the arrak snake, and the flitter, a small flying rodent that can mimic speech.<br>Every five years, Ithorians gather at their planet for the Meet, where the most important decisions regarding Ithorian society are made. During this Time of Meeting the herd cities link up through an intricate and graceful network of bridges and antigrav platforms. <br>Years ago, Imperial Captain Alima, commander of the Star Destroyer <i>Conquest</i>, forced the Ithorian Momaw Nadon to reveal secret agricultural and cloning information. Nadon, High Priest of the <i>Tafanda Bay</i>, gave up the information to save the rain forests and his herd city from destruction. For this transgression, Nadon was exiled from Ithor and lived on Tatooine for many years until exacting his revenge on Alima. <br>Ithor’s herd cities are a common destination for tourists, especially young couples. Wedge Antilles and Imperial scientist Qwi Xux once visited Ithor as a safe haven, although the former Imperial weapons expert was attacked by Kyp Durron, who erased Xux’s memory.",

It was here that the Fallanassi religious community and its leader Wialu settled after departing Lucazec.<br>After leaving Atzerri, Luke Skywalker and Akanah Norand Pell left for J’t’p’tan to search for the Fallanassi. The planet is the site of a H’kig colony, with an estimated population of 13,000, who first arrived some 50 years earlier. The H’kig built a vast stone temple, covering more than 3,000 acres of a small valley, entirely by hand. During the Yevethan Great Purge, the colony was supposedly destroyed. In reality, it was preserved by the Fallanassi, who projected a false image of destruction in order to protect the commune. <br>The Yevetha started a colony on the planet after their conquest. Akanah was reunited with her fellow Fallanassi, and Luke convinced Wialu to help in the fight against the Yevethan fleet. After the Battle of N’zoth, the Fallanassi left J’t’p’tan on the liner <i>Star Morning</i> to find a new home.",

Karrde has a puckish wit. He named his main attack ship <i>Wild Karrde</i> and his space yacht <i>Uwana Buyer</i>. For years his base of operations was the planet Myrkyr, home to the ysalamiri, creatures with the natural ability to deflect or dampen the power of the Force.<br>Karrde provided Rogue Squadron with most of the weapons and munitions it used in its war against Ysanne Isard and her bacta cartel. When Karrde’s top aide, Quelev Tapper, was killed, he hired on a hyperdrive mechanic who called herself Celina Marniss; in reality it was Mara Jade, the Emperor’s Hand, a top aide to the late Emperor Palpatine. Karrde tried to remain neutral in the battles between remnants of the Empire and the Alliance, taking jobs from both. But when Luke Skywalker, his Force powers rendered useless by the ysalamiri, fell into his hands, things changed. Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn, who had contracted with Karrde for some ysalamiri, came to Myrkyr to pick up an even greater prize, young Skywalker. <br>But Luke had escaped, and Karrde and his crew fled their base to escape Thrawn’s wrath.

Karrde was instrumental in getting other smugglers to join him in supporting the New Republic and helped in the victory at Bilbringi.

The plant, known as KDY, has long been one of the Empire’s primary producers of warships and has manufactured the feared <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyer. Due to its strategic importance, the Empire defended the Kuat system with 15 Star Destroyers after the Battle of Endor and rigged the stardocks with explosives in case it was necessary to scuttle them.<br>During their undercover mission to Coruscant, Rogue Squadron pilots Corran Horn and Erisi Dlarit posed as a Kuati telbun and his mistress. Horn wore heavy purple and red robes and a cylinder-shaped hat. The elite on Kuat consider telbuns not worthy of their notice. They are given modified versions of their mistress’s name, indicating to whom they belong. They are taken from the Kuati middle class, and raised to excel at physical, social, and academic pursuits. At the appropriate age they are ranked according to their score on a series of genetic, intelligence, and other breeding-related tests.<br>The upper classes, the families of the legendary Kuat merchant houses, then purchase a telbun for breeding and pay the middle-class family for him. The children of the telbun fathers are considered heirs and full members of the merchant family, but consider only their noble parent as a blood relative. The telbun stays on to raise the children. This is considered a logical and practical method, preventing genetic inbreeding, and it means that members of competing merchant houses can’t have children together, which could complicate matters and blur the distinct lines separating the houses. <br>A Super Star Destroyer called <i>Executor</i> was built at the Kuat yards, and was later renamed <i>Lusankya</i> and buried beneath Coruscant’s surface to serve as the Emperor’s private getaway vessel.",

Killed by an overwhelming force of Jedi, the dark spirit of Exar Kun survived across the vastness of time to challenge Luke Skywalker and a new group of Jedi trainees.<br>Kun was tutored in the ways of the Force on Dantooine by Master Vodo Siosk-Baas. The proud Jedi pushed himself hard, but he was pulled to the dark side of the Force and secretly used his master’s Jedi Holocron to learn about past Dark Lords of the Sith, such as Freedon Nadd. Posing as a Jedi archaeologist, Kun traveled to Onderon to examine Nadd’s Sith artifacts. Jedi Master Arca Jeth saw through Kun’s lies, and an angry Kun left for the city of Iziz and then the Dxun moon to explore Nadd’s influence. Inside Nadd’s tomb he was confronted by the spirit of the Dark Lord himself and was led to two scrolls that contained great Sith secrets. These scrolls in turn led Kun to the desolate planet of Korriban, where, with the help of Nadd’s spirit, he gained access to the Sith tombs.<br>Kun had second thoughts and tried to back out, but was felled by Nadd’s spirit in an attack that left him near death. The only hope, the spirit proclaimed, was to fully embrace the dark side, and however reluctantly, Kun did. In the time that followed, Nadd’s spirit filled him with tales, especially those of the ancient Sith Lord Naga Sadow and the experiments Sadow had performed on the moon of Yavin 4 to give flesh to the spirits of the dead. Nadd told Kun that he must complete Sadow’s work and give Nadd a new body.<br>On Yavin 4, Kun again renounced the dark side, but was attacked by the Massassi, mutated descendants of Sadow’s alchemy. They prepared him for death in a Massassi Blood Sacrifice, and Kun again turned to the dark side to save his life. He slaughtered all who would oppose him, including Nadd’s spirit, but not before it cried out a warning to two other followers, Aleema and Satal Keto, founders of the dark side mystical sect, the Krath.<br>In the months that followed, Kun had the Massassi build huge temples of an ancient Sith design to focus great dark-side energies. He also continued Naga Sadow’s experiments, turning the Massassi into monstrous creatures of death. Then he headed for the Empress Teta system to destroy Nadd’s final Sith followers. He arrived as Jedi Knights were attacking the Krath stronghold. But Aleema and fallen Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma survived. Blasting Aleema with dark-side power, he and Qel-Droma engaged in a blistering lightsaber duel. Sith amulets that both men wore began to glow with energy and ancient Sith Lords appeared and bestowed the title of Dark Lord of the Sith on Kun, and the title of Sith Apprentice on Qel-Droma. Eventually they and Aleema joined forces to try to bring down the Republic and the Jedi Knights.<br>At a Great Council of Jedi convened on Deneba, Master Vodo Siosk-Baas volunteered to try to turn his former student from the dark side, but Kun slew his master. The bloody battles that ensued, known for all time as the Sith War, resulted in millions of deaths. In the end, Qel-Droma betrayed Exar Kun, revealing the secret of Kun’s power base on Yavin 4. The resulting battle leveled most of the moon’s temples and destroyed Kun’s body, but he drained the life force from every Massassi, an act that kept his spirit alive but trapped in the remaining Yavin temples.<br>Some 4,000 years later, the Rebel Alliance briefly established a base on Yavin 4. Later, Luke Skywalker opened a Jedi training academy based in Yavin 4’s Great Temple. Exar Kun’s spirit stirred, tempting first one then another of Skywalker’s trainees into turning to the dark side. He enlisted one promising Jedi, Kyp Durron, until Skywalker saw what was happening and confronted Durron. With the help of Kun, Durron attacked his teacher and used dark-force lightning to separate Skywalker’s spirit from his body. But Kun didn’t reckon on the combined strength of the remaining students, who protected Skywalker’s body from destruction, then set a trap for Kun. They focused their will into a single entity of the Force, finally snuffing out Kun’s spirit, restoring Luke’s essence to his body, and freeing Durron from the hold of the dark side.",

A thousand years later, Exar Kun arrived on Yavin 4 and took command of the Massassi people, again forcing them to construct temples and fortresses on the jungle planet.<br>Long after Kun's defeat during the Sith War, but well before the rise of the Empire, the leaderless Massassi left Yavin 4. They left behind their mysterious temples, along with a vicious guardian creature known as the night beast. When Rebel forces were using Yavin 4 as a base, the beast awakened to fulfill its duty as protector of the Massassi temples. With R2-D2's help, Luke Skywalker managed to lure the night beast into a Rebel supply ship and send it into space.<br>The original Massassi serving Naga Sadow had rust-colored skin and glowing yellow eyes. Their drab brown hair hung to their shoulders, and they had somewhat simian facial features. By the time Exar Kun arrived on Yavin 4, the Massassi had become towering, muscular humanoids with crimson skin and dark eyes. Their faces were slightly feline and rows of quills sprouted from their shoulders. Thousands of years later, Luke Skywalker had a vision in which he saw the Massassi people as pale, gray-green humanoids with smooth skin and large, lantern-like eyes. In all their incarnations, the Massassi were superb combatants, savage yet cunning, who could wield a variety of weapons with deadly proficiency. Their ultimate fate remains uknown.",

Mimban was never colonized by the Circarpousians, but the Empire secretly established a mining operation on the planet. The miners lived in five makeshift towns and worked with energy drills, illegal on populated worlds because their harmful electrical fallout creates a hazard for incoming spaceships.<br>There are at least three intelligent Mimban species: large-eyed Mimbanites, derogatorily called “greenies,” who beg in the mining towns for alcohol; the thin, gray Coway, who live underground; and an unnamed furry species with four legs and four arms. A mysterious, long-extinct species known as the Thrella are believed to have built hundreds of temples and cities that dot the damp surface of Mimban. “Thrella wells,” near-bottomless shafts lined with interlocking hexagonal stones, often have side passages called Coway shafts leading to the Coways’ underground world. One of the world’s most dangerous animals is the huge pale worm called a wandrella; they have black eye-spots surrounding a gaping mouth and are too stupid to be slowed by most attacks.<br>Imperial control of Mimban was entrusted to Captain-Supervisor Grammel, who ruled from the Imperial planetary headquarters built into an ancient towering ziggurat. The legendary Kaiburr Crystal, rumored to have properties that focus and intensify the Force, was located deep in the jungle, in the temple of a minor local god named Pomojema.

The surface of the planet Mon Calamari (sometimes called simply Calamari) is covered with small marshy islands and enormous floating cities that house both species. The Quarren inhabit the lowest, darkest levels. These attractive cities include Reef Home, Coral Depths, Kee-Piru, Coral City, Heurkea, Foam-wander City, the Domed City of Aquaris, and Morjanssik.<br>The architecture and design of Mon Calamari has an organic appearance, with rounded edges and irregular surfaces, demonstrating the inhabitants’ love for the natural beauty of their world. Raw ores used in construction are mined by the Quarren (who can breathe both air and water) from domed cities on the ocean floor. A permanent history of every planetary event is maintained by a community of meter-long, bivalve mollusks, who are extremely intelligent and will communicate their knowledge to those who ask.<br>The Calamarian seas are also home to the dangerous predators known as krakanas, sharklike animals with twin pincer tentacles. The rare ultima-pearl is found in the seabeds. Massive sea slugs, plying Calamari’s oceans, use the Force to draw plankton into their mouths. Other species include the eellike choarn, lampfish with luminous tongues, and the endangered whaladons. In ancient times the planet supported now-extinct, 10-legged crustaceans known as mammoth krabbexs.<br>The Mon Calamari had already constructed enormous starships and begun traveling space when their planet was discovered by the Empire. The Imperials planned to enslave the planet and, after meeting native resistance, destroyed three of its floating cities. A Quarren, Seggor Tels, is believed to have deliberately lowered Calamari’s defenses to allow the Empire’s attack; ever since, tension has been high between the Mon Calamari and the Quarren. After the Empire’s aim was made clear, Calamarian starships were converted into warships and the shipbuilding docks in orbit around Mon Calamari and its single moon became an important resource for the Alliance.<br>Many Calamarians were enslaved by the Empire, including the famous Ackbar, who was forced to be the personal servant of Grand Moff Tarkin. Ackbar was rescued from slavery by an Alliance force and later named admiral of the Rebel fleet. Six years after the Battle of Endor, the reborn clone Emperor used his World Devastators to attack Mon Calamari’s southern territorial zone, destroying most of Kee-Piru and Heurkea. The port city of Hikahi was also damaged, hurting the planet’s starship-building capability. Calamarian ships form the backbone of the New Republic fleet. But with the help of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, the Devastators were defeated. A year after that attack, Princess Leia Organa Solo visited Admiral Ackbar at his home in the seatree forest to bring him out of his self-imposed exile. A subsequent attack by Admiral Daala’s Star Destroyers resulted in the destruction of Reef Home city.",

Although Myrkr was settled for 300 years and lies in the Borderlands Region between Republic and Imperial space, the planet was shunned by both the Old Republic and the Jedi Knights. The historical aversion of the Jedi was due to one of Myrkr’s native life-forms, the tree-dwelling ysalamiri. These creatures had evolved a defensive mechanism allowing them to push the Force from themselves, and many ysalamiri grouped together can create a vast region in which the Force does not exist. Another of Myrkr’s animals, the predatory vornskr, uses the Force to assist in hunting and tracking prey. The high metal content of Myrkr’s trees make sensor readings unreliable, spurring the smuggler Talon Karrde to build his chief base deep in the western part of the Great Northern Forest. This base was overrun by Grand Admiral Thrawn’s forces after Karrde helped Luke Skywalker escape custody in Hyllyard City, Myrkr’s major population center. Ood Bnar, a 5,000-year-old Jedi Master, was a member of the Neti, an alien treelike species that reportedly evolved on Myrkr.",

Nam Chorios has no seas, but there are endless wastelands of sharp, jagged rocks and basalt and quartz outcroppings. Nights are incredibly cold. Chains of crystal mountains reflect sunlight from their sparkling facets, and isolated crystal rock chimneys thrust up toward the sky. The chimneys are called tsils; the Ten Cousins is a group of tsils standing in a ring.<br>Tiny patches of green mark where colonists have managed to gain a foothold for crops. Some 750 years before the Battle of Yavin, political prisoners were exiled to the planet by the Grissmath Dynasty, which seeded the world with insectlike drochs, carriers of the Death Seed plague, hoping that the prisoners would all fall ill and die. Gun stations were set up by the Grissmaths to prevent the rescue of the prisoners, but the prisoners and their guards survived, farming the groundwater seams. Newcomers, the recent post-Imperial arrivals, prefer to use modern technology. The Theran Listeners are cultists who live in the canyons and caves and operate the gun stations. Oldtimers show reverence toward the Therans as healers. The Force is magnified and intensified by the entire planet, making Force usage difficult to control or focus.<br>The planet’s main city is Hweg Shul. Plant life includes brachniel hedges and scrub-loaks, crom and gomex mosses, lichens, podhoy, bolter, blueleaf, snigvine, bott, button-wood trees, and balcrabbian. House-sized, tethered antigrav balls hold soil for smoor, brope, majie, and nisemia thread vine. Metal towers support branswed and topato crops. Animal life includes blerds, gebbecks, alcopays, mikkets, insectlike flying narjams, and cu-pas, brightly colored mounts related to tauntauns but suited for hot climates. Drochs, which burrow into the flesh and are absorbed, consume life and cause the Death Seed plague, but the sunlight fragmenting through Nam Chorios’s crystals weakens them. Captain drochs, grown large from eating other drochs, are cat-sized and crablike, with eyes on long stalks. Platinum and rock-ivory are found in the mountains; spooks, or smokies, are long, green-violet crystals found in clusters in the deep hills.<br>For years, power on the planet rested with Beldorian the Hutt and Seti Ashgad, a profiteer who had been exiled to Nam Chorios by then-Senator Palpatine. Dzym, a mutated droch, kept Ashgad alive and young. Callista, the onetime Jedi who had lost her Force powers, also arrived on the planet, where Beldorian imprisoned her. Nine years after the Battle of Endor, Leia Organa Solo secretly visited the planet to meet with Ashgad. He then turned on her and took her prisoner before unleashing the Death Seed plague across three-quarters of the sector. He planned to disable the planet’s gun stations and allow the Loronar Corporation to strip-mine the smokies.<br>Meanwhile, the forces of Moff Getelles of the Antemeridian sector, bolstered with Loronar’s CCIR needle fighters, invaded the Meridian sector. The whole invasion plan had been masterminded by Dzym to get himself and his fellow drochs off the planet where they had been trapped for so long. Luke Skywalker arrived to find Callista, and his B-wing was shot down. Leia escaped from Ashgad’s fortress and teamed up with Callista. After a series of confrontations, Leia killed Beldorian; Dzym escaped but was destroyed along with the other drochs; Moff Getelles was forced to retreat at the Battle of Nam Chorios; and Callista decided to stay on the planet a while longer.",

The 2,000 stars of the Koornacht Cluster burn so brightly in N’zoth’s night sky that more distant stars are never visible, which contributed to the Yevethan view that their species was the only one in the universe.<br>Females of the species are called marasi and males are called nitakka. Young are born in separate “birth-casks” called mara-nas. Yevetha only consider killing to be murder if someone of lower status kills someone of higher status. High-status males have every right to kill their lessers for any reason, and such killings are commonplace and accepted. Yevetha are extremely adept with technology and learn new skills rapidly.<br>By the time the Empire arrived in the Cluster, the Yevetha had spread from N’zoth and colonized 11 nearby planets, even without hyperdrive technology. The arriving Imperials established an orbiting repair yard (code-named Black 15) at N’zoth and established a planetary garrison on the planet’s surface. The Yevetha were forced to work as Imperial slaves and learned much about the Empire’s technology by servicing its ships at the repair yard. <br>Eight months after the Battle of Endor, faced with mounting losses in battles with the New Republic, the Empire planned to evacuate all forces from N’zoth and to destroy the Black 15 shipyard.

The Black 15 yard was later moved away from N’zoth to a clandestine location. Surface yards on N’zoth became the prime source for spherical thrustships built by the Nazfar Metalworks Guild. 12 years after the Battle of Endor, after the Yevetha captured all alien colony worlds lying inside the Cluster’s borders in the Great Purge, Nil Spaar returned to N’zoth to a hero’s welcome.

Elected senators and administrators from the thousands of member worlds participated in the Republic’s governing process; the Jedi Knights were its protectors and defenders. Arts and science blossomed, and for billions of sentient creatures, the time of the Old Republic was truly a golden age.<br>But starting nearly a standard century before the Galactic Civil War began, corruption, greed, and internal strife destroyed the Republic from within. Special interest groups and power-hungry individuals accomplished what no outside threat ever could: They weakened the government and gave rise to apathy, social injustice, ineffectiveness, and chaos. To try to reverse the destructive trend, or at least to give the impression that something was being done, a compromise candidate, Senator Palpatine, was elected leader of the Senate. Despite his many reassuring promises, Palpatine soon declared himself Emperor. He abolished the Old Republic and began a reign of terror and great social injustice based upon his dark vision of a New Order. His crowning achievement was the Galactic Empire.",

The world's closest moon, Dxun, is home to numerous bloodthirsty creatures capable of migrating to the surface of Onderon during the summer season of the lunar year, when the two worlds' atmospheres intersect. <br>The human inhabitants of Onderon gradually evolved defenses against the beasts, eventually culminating in the enormous walled city of Iziz. Native life on the planet includes the deadly dragon-bird. Over 4,000 years before the Battle of Yavin, the Dark Jedi Freedon Nadd brought the power of Sith dark-side magic to Onderon, and those who opposed him were cast into the wilderness, where they eventually banded together and tamed the beasts of Dxun. Hundreds of these \"beast riders\" created their own kingdoms in the wild, and fought continually to overtake Iziz. <br>Four hundred years after Nadd's death, Onderon was first contacted by the Old Republic, and a delegation of Jedi including Ulic Qel-Droma was sent to make peace between the beast riders and Queen Amanoa of Iziz. Following the death of Queen Amanoa, her daughter Galia took the throne with Oron Kira, her lover and the leader of a beast rider kingdom. A subsequent uprising by the followers of Freedon Nadd was put down by another Jedi force. At the same time, Satal Keto and his cousin Aleema, members of Tetan royalty, traveled to Onderon to learn the secrets of Sith magic, which led to their formation of the Krath and the political takeover of the Tetan system. Following the Naddist uprising, a permanent Jedi outpost was built on Onderon from the remains of Nadd's ancient starship. <br>Later, as the Sith War was coming to a close, Dark Jedi Exar Kun ordered the warrior clans of Mandalore to capture Onderon and the city of Iziz. Defeated in a furious battle by Oron Kira and Captain Vanicus of the Republic navy, Mandalore and his surviving men fled to the Dxun moon. Millennia later, six years after the Battle of Endor, the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> landed on Onderon to repair damage suffered in a battle with the reborn Emperor's flagship, the <i>Eclipse II</i>. Fearing for her newborn son Anakin, Princess Leia Organa Solo hid in warrior leader Modon Kira's safe house deep in the Onderon wilderness. Palpatine, posing as a pilgrim on his way to the Shatoon monastery, discovered the child and tried to possess his body, but was stopped by the Jedi Empatojayos Brand. Later, the leaders of the New Republic gathered in the fortress of Modon Kira and reestablished their galactic government, led by Mon Mothma with Leia Organa Solo as her second in command.",

Because of the dark side forces permeating Iziz, the Jedi were unsuccessful in their mission to bring peace. <br>The war eventually culminated with a beast-rider attack on Iziz more spectacular and violent than any the city had ever known. Hundreds of Beast Lords rallied their troops and seemed to be winning the battle until Queen Amanoa of Iziz evoked the powers of Freedon Nadd, a Dark Jedi entombed within the walled city, to confuse and disorient the invaders. Fortunately, Jedi Master Arca arrived and used the ability of Jedi Battle Meditation to inspire the beast-riders and turn the tide. In the conflict, Queen Amanoa lost her connection to the dark side and died instantly.

Ossus, which orbits the twin Adegan suns in a figure-eight trajectory, was once an important Jedi stronghold and learning center in ancient times. There is even some speculation that the Order of Jedi Knights began on the planet. Ossus was once covered with many cities and ground defenses, with the Knossa spaceport located near a range of rocky mountains. Points of interest included the Great Jedi Library and the peaceful Gardens of Talla. The steep canyon walls are still covered with elaborate murals, and some ancient buildings that still stand include the library and a Jedi meditation chamber. <br>Five thousand years before the birth of Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master Ooroo instructed Odan-Urr in the ways of the Force on Ossus. Odan-Urr later went on to build the Great Jedi Library. One thousand years later, Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas operated a training facility on the tranquil world. Among his students were Nomi Sunrider, Shoaneb Culu, Tith Kark, Qrrl Toq, and Dace Diath. During the Great Sith War, the fallen Jedi Exar Kun visited Ossus to recruit 20 Jedi Knights into the Sith cause. Before he departed, Kun killed Master Odan-Urr and stole a Sith Holocron from the Jedi Library. Later, an Ossan Jedi fleet was dispatched to the nearby Cron Cluster to defend the besieged station Kemplex Nine. The fleet was destroyed when the Cluster went nova, and the resulting shock wave threatened to devastate Ossus. An evacuation of the planet was ordered, and as many ancient relics as possible were loaded onto transports. At the same time, Kun and corrupt Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma appeared with their armies to loot the world of its valuables before the shock wave arrived. Kun battled the Neti Jedi master Ood Bnar, who turned into an unyielding tree to protect a trove of the earliest known lightsabers. <br>Meanwhile, Ulic confronted and killed his brother Cay, and was seized with horror and regret over what he had done. Most Jedi left the planet just ahead of the shock wave, which scorched and nearly wiped clean the surface of Ossus. Some Jedi survived, however, after hiding their families in Ossus' great caverns, and their descendants grew into the Ysanna, a tribe of warrior-shamans who use the Force to guide their primitive weapons. A 10,000-year-old lightsaber, given to Leia Organa Solo by Vima-Da-Boda, surfaced over 800 years before Leia's birth in an archaeological dig on Ossus. Six years after the Battle of Endor, Luke Skywalker visited an arid, sandy portion of the planet and discovered the Ysanna tribe. Skywalker and Kam Solusar also fought the forces of Darkside Executor Sedriss and unearthed the vault of lightsabers long hidden beneath the roots of Master Ood, who bravely sacrificed his own life to end the threat posed by Sedriss. <br>At the time of Skywalker's departure, the New Republic made plans to send excavation teams to explore Ossus' ruins. Soon after, several of the Emperor's warriors came to Ossus and captured three Ysanna leaders, whose bodies were to be used as raw material to create new clones for Palpatine. Skywalker and his Jedi trainees followed the dark-side kidnappers and defeated them on Vjun, but were unable to free the captured Ysanna from their carbonite imprisonment. While on an undercover mission to Borgo Prime 13 years later, Skywalker and Tenel Ka claimed that they needed Corusca gems to open a sealed treasure vault located on Ossus.",

But Gilad Pellaeon wasn’t a survivor because he was a coward; he just thought it smarter to live to fight another day rather than commit some foolish sacrifice.<br>The Corellian, who had lied about his age, graduated in the top third of his class at the Naval Academy. Quick thinking to thwart pirates on his first assignment led to an appointment to the command crew of the Star Destroyer <i>Chimaera</i>. Over the years, he worked his way up to second-in-command, achieving the rank of captain. During the Battle of Endor, the <i>Chimaera</i>’s commander was killed along with other officers and Pellaeon took control of the ship.

Just when he despaired most of the Empire getting a strong new leader, Grand Admiral Thrawn appeared and chose the <i>Chimaera</i> as his new headquarters ship. Thrawn listened to the captain’s opinions, even though he ignored many of them. Pellaeon commanded the <i>Chimaera</i> in the Battle of Sluis Van. Acting on Thrawn’s orders, he then hired Niles Ferrier and Mara Jade to find the location of the long-missing <i>Katana</i> Dreadnaught fleet. Thrawn’s big problem, Pellaeon knew, was overestimating the loyalty and abilities of those who surrounded him. The Battle of Bilbringi was not going well for the Imperials when Rukh, Thrawn’s Noghri bodyguard, killed the admiral. Pellaeon again felt he had no choice but to call a retreat.<br>Years later, with a promotion to the rank of vice admiral, Pellaeon headed the fleet of an Imperial warlord, High Admiral Teradoc. He encountered Admiral Daala, who was trying to get the squabbling Imperial forces to band together, and aided her by inviting the 13 strongest warlords to a unification meeting. But talking didn’t accomplish the task, and Pellaeon watched when Admiral Daala gassed them all. As part of Daala’s grand strategy, Pellaeon led a fleet of Star Destroyers to join with her and destroy the Jedi academy on Yavin 4. But Pellaeon’s fleet was hurled across space by a Force storm brought about by the Jedi trainees, and by the time he got back to the vicinity, the New Republic had vanquished Daala.

Ulic's failure wreaked havoc on the galaxy. Trained along with his younger brother Cay on the mining world of Arkania by Jedi Master Arca Jeth, Ulic Qel-Droma quickly mastered the art of lightsaber dueling. Even then, his self-confidence and brashness made him appear arrogant to some. When he felt they were ready, Master Arca sent the Qel-Dromas and their training partner, Tott Doneeta, to Onderon to help put an end to the violent civil war between the city dwellers and outlander beast-riders. <br>However, the walled city, Iziz, was still full of dark side power some 400 years after the fall of the Sith Dark Lord Freedon Nadd. After some difficulties, Master Arca arrived and helped the outlanders win the war. Soon after, the Jedi found the crypt of Freedon Nadd, leading to an uprising by Nadd loyalists, who kidnapped Master Arca and captured Iziz. Ulic led a contingent of Jedi to free his master and killed King Ommin, Nadd's direct descendant, putting an end to the uprising. During the Freedon Nadd affair, Ulic met and fell in love with another Jedi, Nomi Sunrider, but he was pulled away from her when he was named Watchman of the Empress Teta system. <br>In the following months, two spoiled royals who had been exposed to Sith teachings by the spirit of Freedon Nadd formed the Krath, a group of dark side sorcerors. The Krath fomented war among the Teta system planets, and Ulic decided to infiltrate the group and learn their secrets. Aleema and Satal Keto, the Krath's founders, played along with Ulic. Satal eventually betrayed Ulic and injected him with a slow-acting poison that would make his return to the light side impossible. Ulic later survived an assassination attempt by Satal, and saw Nomi escape Satal's imprisonment just hours before he had agreed to kill her to prove his loyalty to the Krath. Nomi and Cay Qel-Droma failed in their attempt to rescue Ulic from the Krath, and the anger inside Ulic exploded, leading him to kill Satal. <br>Aleema gave him half of a Sith amulet that had been given to Satal by the spirit of Freedon Nadd, furthering Ulic's transformation. Ulic was then confronted by another fallen Jedi, Exar Kun. As they engaged in a lightsaber battle, both Jedi were visited by the spirits of ancient Sith lords who told them that Kun was to become the new Dark Lord of the Sith, with Qel-Droma his first assistant. <br>Years later Ulic reappeared with tremendous dark side powers, and with a large and bloodthirsty army. Serving alongside Exar Kun, he set out to plunder and destroy large parts of the galaxy. The Jedi Knights and the Republic declared him an enemy, and the subsequent battles, which became known as the Sith Wars, were among the largest and bloodiest conflicts the galaxy had ever known. Millions perished as a result of Qel-Droma's evil. Ulic eventually murdered his own brother, Cay, but was consumed with guilt over this deed and finally turned away from the dark side.

In recent history, Ralltiir was an attractive, high-technology world famous for its banking industry and home to the Grallia Spaceport.<br>The planet’s powerful financial institutions were politically neutral and had a reputation as a safe haven for investors’ funds. With the rise of the Empire, certain factions infiltrated Ralltiir’s financial system and began to steer its markets in a pro-Imperial direction, by erasing the fiscal records of nonhuman investors, for instance. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, pro-Alliance members of the Ralltiir High Council tried to restore balance to the markets. Their efforts inspired the Emperor to use Ralltiir as an example to other worlds that would resist his will. A brutal Imperial force, led by Lord Tion, invaded Ralltiir and devastated the planet and its 10 billion inhabitants. <br>Tion disbanded the High Council, replaced it with a military tribunal headed by Imperial Governor Dennix Graeber, and set up interrogation centers and public executions of Rebel leaders. He also sealed off the entire Ralltiir system (even barring relief organizations from traveling through his blockade), which severely hurt commerce along the Perlemian Trade Route.<br>Princess Leia Organa, on a mercy mission to deliver medical supplies and equipment to the High Council of Ralltiir, was permitted to land by Tion. The princess rescued a wounded Rebel soldier, who later revealed the existence of the Death Star project. Ralltiir’s economy had been left in ruins, and many powerful corporations relocated off-world. But Governor Graeber got rich by secretly supplying the Rebel underground with weapons, which he then used as a justification to persecute Ralltiir’s citizens even more harshly. <br>Before the Battle of Yavin, an Alliance raid on the Cygnus Corporation’s starfighter performance trials near Ralltiir resulted in the capture of the Assault Gunboat design team. Inath of Ralltiir, who years later became a member of the New Republic’s Council, had seen many of his associates murdered by the Emperor’s Noghri assassins, which led him to pressure Chief of State Leia Organa Solo to retire her Noghri bodyguards, claiming that they sent the wrong signal.",

One side of the planet always faces the sun and the only habitable areas are in the band of twilight separating the two sides. Heat storms in Ryloth’s thin atmosphere help to distribute warmth throughout the twilight zone, where the Twi’leks live in a network of mountain catacombs. Wind-driven turbines power their primitive industrial civilization, and raw fungi and cowlike rycrits are raised for food. Ryloth’s primary exports are the addictive ryll spice and Twi’lek females, who are desired for their seductive dancing skills.<br>The Twi’lek government is organized around a five-member head clan that is in charge of all community decisions. When one member of the clan dies, the remaining four are exiled into the day-side desert (the Bright Lands) and a new head clan is selected. A major Twi’lek corporation, Galactic Exotics, developed orchards on the planet Belsavis. Ryloth is also home to SchaumAssoc., a Twi’lek advertising agency that pioneered media and public relations for the Corporate sector.<br>Years ago, a small Imperial refueling center and training outpost was established on Ryloth, supported by the Empire yet often used by smugglers. Tarkin, then a commander, had plans to turn the refueling station into an important base. Jabba the Hutt’s majordomo, Bib Fortuna, was one of the first to widely sell ryll spice off-planet, which attracted the Empire’s attention and brought slavers to Ryloth. Fortuna was sentenced to death but escaped and returned later with an army of Jabba’s thugs to exact revenge. Seven Ryloth cities were burned and Jabba took slaves and riches, while Fortuna rescued Nat Secura, the last son of a great Twi’lek family. Fortuna made plans to someday return with Secura and rule Ryloth as he saw fit. Not long before the Battle of Endor, Fortuna enslaved a clan chief’s daughter named Oola, and trained her to serve as a dancer in Jabba’s palace. Maw Installation scientist Tol Sivron, Rogue Squadron pilot Nawara Ven, and the ancient Jedi Knight Tott Doneeta were also natives of Ryloth.<br>After the New Republic retook Coruscant, Rogue Squadron flew a mission to Ryloth to obtain ryll kor, which was mixed with bacta to produce rylca, a cure for the Krytos virus. They landed at Kala’uun Starport, within one of the mountains known as the Lonely Five. The Twi’lek warrior Tal’dira and his pilots later joined with the squadron; they flew X-TIE hybrids called Chir’daks, or Deathseeds.",

Rays can destroy ships carrying only standard shielding. Even though Nkllon is so hot that beings can live only on the night side of the planet, turned away from the sun, its mineral resources proved too valuable to pass up for a gambling man like Lando Calrissian, who devised a gigantic mobile unit, Nomad City, to mine the ore.<br>The 12 shieldships were built by the newly formed Republic Engineering Corporation. They proved both difficult to pilot and to maintain, and substantial downtime had to be part of their schedules. The ships were, in effect, giant sun umbrellas. Immense 800-meter-wide cones acted as shields. Their faces were covered by thick armor plating honeycombed with coolant chambers, and their backs had huge tubes and fins to vent off the intense heat. The shadow behind the shield formed the protected area for incoming starships. Trailing behind each shield was a 400-meter pylon with a drive tug that provided sublight and hyperdrive thrust.<br>Normally, the shieldship simply took control of the escorted vessel via slave circuit at the Outer-Rim depot and jumped into the heart of the system, bringing the other vessel along for a ride that took about one standard hour. Ships without slave circuits had to be escorted to Nkllon on sublight drives, which took about 10 hours. <br>The success of the mining operation and its New Republic ties made it a target for Grand Admiral Thrawn. His second attack on Nomad City destroyed its drive units and long-range communications, and Star Destroyers attacking the Outer-Rim depot disabled all but one of the shieldships.",

Sh'ner planetary assault carriers usually remain back from the main battle lines until the target world has been defeated. The carriers then move into high orbit to launch P'w'eck-staffed <i>D'kee</i>-class landing ships. Slow and underpowered, Sh'ner carrier ships are closer to transports than combat ships. Their weak shields make them easy targets for enemy vessels. Sh'ner carriers also have minimal weaponry: only six ion cannons, two tractor beam projectors, and 24 battle droids for emergencies. They normally rely on Fw'Sen picket ships for armed escort. The interior of a Sh'ner carrier holds nearly a dozen entechment labs for rapidly processing prisoners; giant batteries store the enteched life energies until they are needed.<br>A small command and entechment lab crew consists of only about 60 Ssi-ruuk, while about 500 P'w'ecks and 300 enteched droids are used as assistants and for manual labor. Each of the three P'w'eck landing ships aboard is armed with 100 paralysis canisters that can be dropped over major population centers, explode at an altitude of 1,000 meters, and spread Ssi-ruuvi paralysis toxins over an area nearly nine square kilometers in size. When target cities have been effectively neutralized, the Sh'ner carrier's landing ships descend to gather entechment subjects. Each landing ship can carry nearly 10,000 prisoners in confinement pens. The Bakura invasion fleet had three Sh'ner carriers, which retreated to the main Ssi-ruuvi battle fleet after Luke Skywalker captured the <i>Shriwirr</i> battle cruiser.",

She was accompanying her husband on a mission to take some Adegan crystals, used to construct lightsabers, to Jedi Master Thon in the Ambria system when Andur was cut down by several henchmen of Great Bogga the Hutt. Urged on by his spirit, she picked up his lightsaber and slew two of the thugs before continuing with his mission.<br>On the planet Ambria, Thon convinced her to stay and train to be a Jedi herself. Once, she saved her daughter from an attack by a dark-side monster by creating a vision of the beasts attacking one another through the use of Jedi battle meditation, and later used the technique to defeat a band of pirates on a mission from Bogga. Her training took her to the planet Ossus, where she apprenticed with Master Vodo-Siosk Baas and learned to make her own lightsaber. She was then drafted to join a Jedi team to battle Dark Siders, who were taking over the planet Onderon, and to rescue Master Arca Jeth and his students. She developed strong feelings for her team member Ulic Qel-Droma. Nomi stayed to train with Arca in the Force mind technique known as Jedi battle meditation, gaining in both physical strength and self-confidence.<br>Arca assigned Nomi and Qel-Droma to lead a joint peacekeeping force of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Knights to defeat the challenge of the dark-side Krath cult and the dark magicians of the Sith. After a pitched battle, Qel-Droma told Nomi that he would infiltrate the Krath and learn their dark-side ways, even though Nomi urged him against such action. Her warning was prescient. She and two other Jedi later tried to extract Qel-Droma from virtual imprisonment in the Empress Teta system, but he had been injected with Sith poison that led to an explosion of anger and his loss to the dark side.

He hid his ship in the ice ring surrounding Taanab’s moon, and when the pirates made their run, he ejected hundreds of conner nets into the center of the attacking fleet. As the pirates struggled to untangle themselves, Calrissian hit them with ice blocks from the moon’s ring, causing even further damage. Finally, Calrissian led the Taanab defense fleet in a cleanup operation and singlehandedly accounted for nineteen kills. Later, just prior to the Battle of Endor, Calrissian was promoted to the rank of general in the Alliance partly thanks to the notoriety of this incident, which became known as the Battle of Taanab. Some five years later, mad Jedi clone Joruus C’baoth coordinated an Imperial attack on Taanab, where he used the turbolasers of the <i>Bellicose</i> to destroy a New Republic ship against the direct orders of Captain Aban.",

He set Jabba up to be killed by an Imperial inspection party, but Jabba learned of his plot and planned to wait him out. When Tessek heard that, he killed the messenger, a B’omarr monk whose brain was housed in a large spider-shaped droid. <br>Tessek’s plans were further compromised when Jabba insisted that he accompany his party out to the Great Pit of Carkoon to execute a number of Rebels. The Rebels, led by Luke Skywalker, had other plans. Tessek escaped just as Jabba’s sail barge was blown up. He returned to the Hutt’s palace, where some of the dead monk’s associates cornered him. They turned him into a monk himself by laser-cutting his brain out of his body and sticking it into a nutrient jar atop a spider droid.",

		"description": "A system located near the Kuar system containing seven carbonite-mining worlds, including Kirrek and Koros Major. The Empress Teta system is named for the female warlord who conquered it some five millennia before the Galactic Civil War. The Tetan mines produce raw carbonite, primarily from the thick outer rings of a gas giant in the system. The carbonite is a vital ingredient in the construction of hyperdrives. The royal descendants of Empress Teta long ruled the system, sharing power and profits with the leaders of the influential Carbonite Guild.<br>About 4,000 years before the Galactic Civil War, the privileged sons and daughters of Tetan royalty began experimenting with the dark side of the Force, introduced to them by the royal heirs Satal Keto and Aleema. They formed a group known as the Krath, which used Sith magic and military force to quickly conquer the system. Public executions of rebellious carbonite miners were held in the central plaza of the ruling Tetan city of Cinnagar. The Krath took up residence in Cinnagar’s iron citadel, which contained an inner city and an opulent palace behind its walls. Beneath the citadel were underground dungeons and a vast cavern, where the Krath hanged  political prisoners.<br>The Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma, following a Tetan attack on a Deneban Jedi assembly, traveled to Cinnagar in order to learn the Krath’s dark-side secrets. In the ensuing months Satal Keto was killed and a Jedi attack force attempted to rescue Qel-Droma from the iron citadel, but he had succumbed to the dark side and insisted on remaining in Cinnagar. Qel-Droma joined forces with the Sith Lord Exar Kun, and the two implemented their plans to bring about a new Golden Age of the Sith. Some time later, as the Krath armies conquered nearby systems, the warlord Mandalore chose to strike at the heart of the overextended Tetan empire. Ulic Qel-Droma defeated Mandalore in single combat and won the warlord’s loyalty and the use of his deadly armies. Later, Aleema attempted to reassert her power over the Krath forces by abandoning Qel-Droma during an attack on Coruscant, but he was rescued and eventually Aleema was killed.",

While other rulers of the Old Republic scoffed at such notions, Empress Teta trusted Odan-Urr's premonitions and prepared for war. When the Sith did arrive, beginning the Great Hyperspace War, Teta was fully prepared. Her forces managed to protect several worlds, including Coruscant, and ultimately drove the Sith from the Old Republic. Not content with this victory, Teta pursued the Sith to their home system, scattering the Sith Empire completely.",

Thyferra is a green and white world covered with rain forests; it has little axial tilt and is unbearably humid. It has two airless, uninhabited moons and orbits a yellow star. Thyferra was first contacted during the middle years of the Old Republic. Although the Vratix already had colonized other bodies in their system, contact with the Republic ushered in a technological revolution.<br>The Vratix soon invented the healing fluid called bacta by growing alazhi and mixing it with the chemical kavam. The remarkable fluid was extremely profitable, and powerful Vratix operations spread across many worlds. With the rise of the Empire, two large bacta-harvesting corporations, Xucphra and Zaltin, negotiated a special deal with the Imperials, allowing the companies to gain a virtual monopoly on the bacta industry. The conglomerates controlled 95 percent of the galaxy’s bacta and became known as the Bacta Cartel. The human-owned companies long dominated the lives of the Vratix and ran the government. Total bacta output averaged 17 billion liters a year.<br>The planet-wide government was led by two canirs (chief officers) appointed by an elected council, each canir representing one of the two corporations. Because Xucphra and Zaltin were competitors, there was frequent governmental gridlock. The Ashern (Black Claw) terrorist group, which viewed the corporations as a threat, attempted to topple them. In the political confusion following the Battle of Endor, Thyferra remained neutral and profited by selling bacta to both sides. Two and a half years after Endor, the New Republic, anxious to please the Thyferran leaders, recruited the human pilots Bror Jace (from Zaltin) and Erisi Dlarit (from Xucphra) into the famous Rogue Squadron.<br>Thyferra has three spaceports. The main one is Zalxuc City, which was renamed Xucphra City after former Imperial Intelligence head Ysanne Isard took over control of Xucphra and put the squeeze on Zaltin as she became the planet’s Head of State. Foreign workers, who are hired to make the bacta runs, stay in segregated areas around the spaceport. The port’s main building is a low two-story rectangle, with akonije trees growing through it and out the roof. The alazhi is harvested and kavam synthesized primarily on Thyferra, but there are dozens of colony worlds elsewhere, including Qretu-Five.<br>After Rogue Squadron’s conquest of Borleias, Bror Jace was called back to Thyferra due to a relative’s grave illness. After being notified by a spy, the Interdictor cruiser <i>Black Asp</i>, operating near Thyferra, dragged his X-wing out of hyperspace and destroyed it, apparently killing Jace. (His presumed death became a convenient cover story.) After the capture of Coruscant, the New Republic was especially dependent on Thyferra to provide bacta for treating the Krytos virus, which Isard had unleashed as part of her plan to corner the bacta trade and become both wealthy and powerful. A deadly Bacta War ensued, with Rogue Squadron fighting Isard, but not under New Republic auspices. In the end, the Rogues were victorious. They were welcomed back into Republic service, and Thyferra voted to join the New Republic.",

Prince Xizor was also highly political and was probably the third most powerful individual in the galaxy. He schemed to supplant number two, Darth Vader, and possibly even take over the Emperor’s job at some point. Xizor was more than 100 years old, with the body of a well-sculpted 30-year-old thanks to its crafting by myostim units. A Falleen, Xizor was tall with a slightly elevated, sharp reptilian ridge over his spine. His head was bald except for a long topknot and ponytail. Xizor exuded natural pheromones that made most humanoids feel instantly attracted to him; his skin color, normally a dusky green, changed with the rise of those pheromones, going from the cool into the warm spectrum of colors.<br>Xizor harbored a particular hatred for Vader. About a decade before the Battle of Hoth, Vader had established a biological weapons lab on Xizor’s planet. An accident let a tissue-destroying bacterium escape, so Vader ordered the city near the lab burned to ashes, killing 200,000 Falleen including Xizor’s entire family. Xizor, who was off-world, destroyed all records of the family tragedy so that no one would know of his personal reasons for despising Vader and his pledge to avenge the deaths. When he heard that Vader was seeking Luke Skywalker to convert him to the dark side of the Force, and that young Skywalker was Vader’s son, he plotted to have Luke killed and Vader’s plans thwarted. Xizor’s huge castle on Imperial Center was only a short walk through protected corridors to Vader’s palace. Every time Vader set foot outside his castle, Xizor had him under constant surveillance. Xizor had a number of legitimate businesses into which he funneled much of the ill-gotten gains of Black Sun. The largest of these was a shipping company, Xizor Transport Systems (XTS).<br>Because attracting females was so easy for Xizor, he quickly tired of them. But he considered Princess Leia Organa a real challenge, although he was confident he could win her over with his pheromones. Leia initiated the contact in her attempts to find out who was trying to murder Luke. At their first meeting, Leia was indeed taken with Xizor’s beauty, and she nearly let herself be seduced. But his spell over her was broken when Chewbacca interrupted their meeting and whisked Leia away. When Leia returned, she kneed Xizor in the groin, turning herself into a prisoner. Xizor had his female human-replica droid, Guri, take Leia to her locked room, then informed her that she was bait to lure Luke.<br>When Luke, Lando Calrissian, Dash Rendar, and Chewbacca broke into Xizor’s castle through its lowest levels, the prince was at first reluctant to admit that his tight security measures could have been overcome. But Xizor became convinced that his castle had been infiltrated after Guri was bashed by Leia. Soon, Xizor came face-to-face with Luke Skywalker and a fearsome battle ensued. When Skywalker produced a thermal detonator, Xizor let the group leave unmolested, but not before Calrissian dropped another detonator with a five-minute timer down a chute. Xizor escaped to his skyhook, <i>Falleen’s Fist</i>, using his ship <i>Virago</i>. But in a final confrontation with Darth Vader, he was killed when Vader ordered Xizor’s skyhook retreat blown to bits.",

They begin life on land, then move into water as adults, their legs replaced by tails and their lungs by gills. This transformation into adult form, called the Changing Ceremony, happens around a Melodie’s twentieth year and takes place in a shallow pool coated with a unique, air-supplying algae. The Melodies are unable to leave their pools during the transformation, which can take weeks, and are thus particularly vulnerable to Yavin 8’s many land-based predators.<br>The young Melodies perform most of the necessary functions of their primitive society because the elders can no longer leave the streams and lakes. Abundant animal life includes silver-backed fish and many species of herbivorous burrowers and their carnivorous counterparts, such as the loper and moss-hopper. Seventeen species of grazers, including the wolbak, dysart, dontopod, and songbuk, inhabit the moon’s tundra and mountain ranges. Predators include snakelike reels, color-changing ursods, rodentlike raiths, flying avrils, serpentine ropedancers, and arachnid purellas.<br>Around 4,000 years before the Battle of Yavin, members of Yavin 4’s Massassi species journeyed to Yavin 8 to seek help for their children, who had been magically trapped in a golden globe by the Dark Jedi Exar Kun. When the Melodie elders were unable to help them, the Massassi carved the story of their plight in the rocks of the Sistra mountain in the hopes that someone would eventually be able to break the curse. Some 18 years after the Battle of Endor, Anakin Solo and the Jedi trainee Tahiri traveled to Yavin 8 to take their friend Lyric to her Changing Ceremony within the Sistra mountain.

The plans made it to Rebel headquarters on Yavin 4 despite the capture and subsequent rescue of Princess Leia Organa, but the Empire had tracked Leia’s rescuers to the once-secret base. With only about 30 standard minutes before the Death Star would be close enough to obliterate Yavin 4, the Rebels mustered every ship they had. The stakes were high, with only two possible outcomes: survival of the Rebel Alliance or total destruction. <br>The Rebel plan depended on the ability of a single starfighter to navigate the Death Star trenches, all the while avoiding laser fire from gun towers and TIE fighters, and to score a direct hit with a proton torpedo on a small, unshielded thermal exhaust vent to start a chain reaction that would blow up the battle station’s power core.<br>The battle seemed to be going badly for the Rebels. Although they held their own for a while and their superior piloting skills took many Imperials out of the fight, the sheer numerical superiority of the Imperials began to take its toll. As the Death Star started to clear the edge of Yavin and get a clear shot at the Rebel base on its fourth moon, all appeared lost. But a young farmboy from Tatooine turned off his targeting computer and, using nothing but the power of the Force, made the one-in-a-million shot that marked the beginning of the end of the Empire.

Zuckuss joined forces with the warped protocol droid 4-LOM to serve Jabba the Hutt, and later sought out Han Solo for Darth Vader. Although he missed his opportunity to capture Solo, Zuckuss inadvertently found himself rescuing a number of Rebels fleeing the Battle of Hoth. Touched by their devotion to one another and their willingness to accept him without reservation, Zuckuss joined the Alliance and began a long road toward redemption.",
